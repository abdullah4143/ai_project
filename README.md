## 📝 Project Summary

This project is a full-stack AI-powered blogging platform that enhances the writing experience by integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) features such as **content paraphrasing** and **summarization**. The platform allows users to write, edit, and improve their blog posts using AI tools.

The frontend is built with **Next.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, offering a smooth and modern user interface. The backend is developed using **Node.js** and **Express**, while the AI functionalities are powered by **Python models** hosted on **Google Colab** and exposed to the frontend via **ngrok** tunnels.

Users can:
- Sign up and log in
- Create blog posts
- Use AI to paraphrase or summarize their content for clarity and variety

This solution combines web development with real-time AI services, offering a hands-on demonstration of how language models can be integrated into everyday web applications.
